Time: 02:53 [ ] AM [X] PM (14:53:48)

Location:

Urban street sidewalk in front of a commercial building/storefront. (Cyrillic signage visible on the building).

Describe the Incident:

A flatbed truck carrying a heavy load of bagged construction materials was traveling down the main road.

The truck suddenly veered to the right, departing the roadway.

The vehicle mounted the curb, crossing the sidewalk.

The truck collided head-on with the corner structure of a building.

The impact caused significant structural damage to the building and the truck's cab. The cargo (heavy bags) shifted forward, crushing the cab area and creating a debris cloud.



INJURIES

Was anyone injured? [X] Yes [ ] No

(Driver injury is highly probable given the cab damage; pedestrian injury was narrowly avoided).

If yes, describe the injuries:
