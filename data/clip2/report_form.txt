THE INCIDENT

Date of Incident: [Date Unknown] Time: [Time Unknown] [ ] AM [X] PM (Incident occurs at night)

Location:

Urban intersection in a Russian-speaking region (indicated by Cyrillic signage). Notable landmark: Signage for "СТРОИТЕЛЬНЫЕ МАТЕРИАЛЫ" (Building Materials) on the corner and "АПТЕКА" (Pharmacy) in the background.

Describe the Incident:

A white sedan was slowly navigating the intersection, appearing to be executing a left turn or crossing the lanes.

A dark-colored sedan entered the frame from the bottom-left, traveling at a high rate of speed.

The dark sedan appeared to lose traction and was sliding sideways (drifting) across the center lane markers.

The side of the sliding dark sedan impacted the rear-right quarter of the white sedan.

The force of the impact caused the white sedan to spin 180 degrees and come to a stop facing the opposite direction. The dark sedan continued to slide past the point of impact.
