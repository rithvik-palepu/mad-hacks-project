# EvidenceCheck MVP

**Video ↔ Text Consistency Checker**

A minimal viable product that analyzes short video clips and compares them against text descriptions to determine consistency. This tool detects people, cars, and weapons in videos and checks if the counts match what's described in text.

## 🎯 Project Overview

EvidenceCheck MVP is designed to:
- Take a short video clip (10-30 seconds)
- Take a text description of that clip
- Analyze both and provide a consistency score (0-100)
- Show detailed per-claim breakdown

### Supported Claim Types (v1)
- **Number of people**: "Three people", "2 persons", etc.
- **Number of cars/vehicles**: "Two cars", "1 vehicle", etc.
- **Weapon presence/absence**: "gun present", "no weapon", etc.

## 🐳 Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

**The easiest way to run EvidenceCheck - no Python setup needed!**

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))
- Git installed

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rithvik-palepu/mad-hacks-project.git
   cd mad-hacks-project
   ```

2. **Build and run with Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   
   ⚠️ **First build takes 5-10 minutes** (downloading dependencies)

3. **Open your browser:**
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`
   - App should be running!

4. **Stop the application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

**That's it!** No Python, no virtual environments, no dependency management needed.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project consists of four main modules:

1. **`video_analyzer.py`**: Uses YOLOv8 to detect objects in video frames
2. **`text_parser.py`**: Extracts claims from text using regex patterns
3. **`scoring.py`**: Calculates consistency score between claims and video analysis
4. **`app.py`**: Streamlit web interface for user interaction

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd "MadHacks 2025"
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - **Windows (PowerShell):**
     ```powershell
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
   - **Windows (Command Prompt):**
     ```cmd
     venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note:** First-time installation may take a few minutes as it downloads:
   - PyTorch and related libraries
   - YOLOv8 model weights (downloaded automatically on first run)

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Using the Application

1. **Upload a video file:**
   - Click "Browse files" or drag and drop a video
   - Supported formats: MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV
   - Recommended: 10-30 second clips, well-lit scenes

2. **Enter text description:**
   - Paste or type a description in the text area
   - Include mentions of people, cars, or weapons

3. **Click "Analyze":**
   - Wait for video processing (may take 10-30 seconds)
   - View results: consistency score, claim details, and annotated frames

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Basic Functionality Test

**Purpose:** Verify the application works end-to-end

1. **Prepare test video:**
   - Use a short video (10-30 seconds) showing:
     - 2-3 people clearly visible
     - 1-2 cars visible
     - No weapons

2. **Test description:**
   ```
   There were three people and two cars in the parking lot. No weapons were present.
   ```

3. **Expected results:**
   - Video should detect people and cars
   - Score should reflect accuracy of counts
   - Sample frames should show bounding boxes around detected objects

### Test Case 2: People Count Accuracy

**Purpose:** Test people detection accuracy

1. **Video:** Record or use a video with exactly 2 people
2. **Text:** "Two people were present in the scene."
3. **Expected:** Score should be high (80-100) if count matches

**Variations to test:**
- Text says "one person" when video has 2 → Score should drop (~70-80)
- Text says "three people" when video has 2 → Score should drop (~70-80)
- Text says "two people" when video has 2 → Score should be 100

### Test Case 3: Cars Count Accuracy

**Purpose:** Test vehicle detection accuracy

1. **Video:** Record or use a video with exactly 1 car
2. **Text:** "One car was parked in the lot."
3. **Expected:** Score should be high if detection is accurate

**Variations:**
- Text says "two cars" when video has 1 → Score penalty
- Text says "no cars" when video has 1 → Score penalty

### Test Case 4: Weapon Detection

**Purpose:** Test weapon detection (note: limited by YOLOv8 capabilities)

1. **Video:** Use a video with a knife or similar weapon visible
2. **Text:** "A knife was visible in the scene."
3. **Expected:** If weapon detected, score should reflect match

**Note:** Standard YOLOv8 may not reliably detect guns. Knives are more likely to be detected.

### Test Case 5: Multiple Claims

**Purpose:** Test system with multiple claim types

1. **Video:** Scene with 2 people, 1 car, no weapons
2. **Text:** "There were two people near one car. No weapons were present."
3. **Expected:** All three claims should be evaluated, combined score provided

### Test Case 6: Edge Cases

**No claims in text:**
- **Text:** "Something happened in the parking lot."
- **Expected:** No claims extracted, score may default or show info message

**Video too dark/blurry:**
- **Text:** "Three people were visible."
- **Expected:** Lower detection accuracy, score should reflect this

**Video too long/short:**
- Test with 5-second video → may work but limited frames
- Test with 60-second video → processing takes longer

## 📝 Example Test Videos

### Creating Test Videos

**Option 1: Use existing videos**
- Find short clips online (respecting copyright)
- Use your own recorded clips

**Option 2: Record test videos**
- Use phone camera to record:
  - Parking lot with visible cars
  - People walking in frame
  - Well-lit, daytime scenes
- Keep clips to 10-30 seconds

**Option 3: Use video editing software**
- Create simple test scenes
- Add multiple people/cars to same frame for easier testing

### Sample Test Descriptions

```
Example 1:
"There were three people walking through the parking lot. Two cars were visible. No weapons were present."

Example 2:
"Two men were standing near a single vehicle. A weapon was not visible."

Example 3:
"One person entered the area. There were no cars and no weapons in the scene."
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Module not found" errors:**
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Reinstall requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**2. YOLOv8 download issues:**
- First run downloads model weights (~6MB)
- Check internet connection
- Weights cached after first download

**3. Video won't process:**
- Check video format (supported: MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV)
- Ensure video is not corrupted
- Try a shorter clip (10-30 seconds)

**4. Poor detection accuracy:**
- Use well-lit, daytime videos
- Ensure objects are clearly visible
- Avoid very dark or blurry footage

**5. Streamlit not starting:**
- Check if port 8501 is already in use
- Try: `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`

## 📊 Scoring Logic

The consistency score starts at 100 and deducts points for mismatches:

- **People/Cars Count:**
  - Exact match: No penalty
  - Difference of 1: -10 points
  - Difference > 1: -30 points

- **Weapon Presence:**
  - Match: No penalty
  - Mismatch: -40 points

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (MVP)

- **Weapon detection:** Limited to knives in standard YOLOv8. Guns may not be detected reliably.
- **Night scenes:** Not supported; requires daytime/well-lit footage
- **Complex actions:** Only static counts supported (no actions or timelines)
- **Audio:** Not analyzed
- **Multiple cameras:** Single camera perspective only
- **Roles:** Cannot distinguish officer/suspect roles

## 🔧 Development Notes

- **Model:** Uses YOLOv8n (nano) by default for speed. Can switch to 'yolov8s.pt' or 'yolov8m.pt' in `video_analyzer.py` for better accuracy.
- **Frame sampling:** Defaults to 1 frame per second. Adjustable via `frame_rate` parameter.
- **Confidence threshold:** 0.5 (50%) for object detections. Adjustable in code.
